<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Bolutayo Oluwatobi Samuel, I am 28years old. I currently reside in Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria, where I have built a life
  rich in experience and learning. I had my early education at Ola Oluwa Nursery and Primary School, Odode Idanre where I obtained 
  Primary School Leaving Certificate. I then proceeded to Olofin Anglican Grammar School for my SSCE. I had my first tertiary 
  experience at the Federal Polytechnic, Ado-Ekiti where I bagged a distinction in Science Technology at the National Diploma level.
  I later proceeded to the Federal University of Technology, Akure via Direct Entry to study Biochemistry and graduated with a second
  class (Upper Division).

  Growing up in the hilly-invested Idanre, I developed a passion for technology, which has significantly shaped who I am today. From
  a young age, I have always been curious about the world around me. This curiosity led me to explore various fields, including Technology.
  Because tech is a creative endeavour, I found joy in discovering new things and pushing my boundaries.

  In my freetime, I enjoy engaging in sport activities, listening to music and reading.These pursuits not only provide me with relaxation
  but also allow me to express myself and connect with others who share similar interests. I believe hobbies are essential for personal
  growth, as they offer a break from routine and foster creativity.

  Looking to the future, I aspire to become a full-stack website developer. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and I am
  committed to making a positive impact in my community and beyond. I hope to continue learning, growing, and contributing to the world 
  in meaningful ways.
